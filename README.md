source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install required packages

### Step 4: Create `.env` file with your API key

Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory containing:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

### Starting the Web Interface

```bash
# Ensure your virtual environment is activated
python gemini_webui.py
